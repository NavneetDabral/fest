         </div>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <br>
        
Teams have to build an autonomous robot which can follow a black line. The bot has to analyze the path in the dry run and has to go through the maze from the starting point to the ending point in minimum possible time.
        <br>
<h3>Arena:</h3>
The game field consists of an arena having dimensions 224 cm X 228 cm (lxb).<br>
It consists of the following:<br>
        
The arena is composed of random paths made up of black strips.
Angle between two adjacent white lines in the path is 90o.
The width of all white stripes will be 30mm.
A white box of 330 mm x 330 mm is present at the end zone of the arena to indicate the end position.
        <br>
<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
The bot must start from the 'Start' and find its way to reach the 'End'.The bot has to give a signal by glowing a LED as soon as it reaches the 'END' of the track.
<br>
    <h3> Checkpoints:</h3> 
        
Their will be certain checkpoints  the game.
Each check point carries 25 Points.

<h3>BOT SPECIFICATIONS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The autonomous bot must fit into the box of dimension 220 mm X 220 mm X 220 mm (l x b x h).
</li>
            <li>Bot must be started individually by only one switch. However a team may have onboard switch for restart. This switch has to be shown to the organizer before the run.
</li>
            <li>Bot must have a red LED which will glow once it reaches the end zone of the arena.
</li>
            <li>During the run, the autonomous bot must not damage the arena in any way. It is not allowed to leave anything behind or make any marks while traversing the arena. Any bot found damaging the arena will be immediately disqualified. The final decision is at the discretion of the organizers.
</li>
            <li>Bot must have on board power supply.</li>
            <li>When using the electric power supply, the potential difference between any 2 points must not exceed 24V at any point of time during the game.
</li>
            <li>The autonomous bot should not separate or split into two or more units. All bots/units which are touching each other or are in the starting point will be considered as one bot.
</li>
        </ul>
        
<h3>Game Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed.</li>
        <li>When the autonomous bot starts, no team member can touch the bot or enter the arena.
</li>
        <li>At the start of the task, the bot will be placed at the starting point. Only 1 team member can be near the game field while starting the bot.
</li>
        <li>Run will start only when organizers give the signal.</li>
        <li>The starting procedure of the bot should be simple and should not involve giving bot any manual force or impulse in any direction.
</li>
        <li>A total of 5 minutes and 30 seconds will be given</li>
        </ul>



. 
<h3>Restarts:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The participants are allowed to take a maximum of 3 restarts in the entire match.
</li>
            <li>If the bot takes a restart in any part of the competition, it has to start from the checkpoint.
</li>
            <li>The timer will not be set back to zero and will not be paused in any case.
</li>
            <li>During a restart, a contestant must not feed information about the arena to the bot. However, contestants are allowed to adjust sensors (gain, position etc.) and make hardware changes.
</li>
            <li>
                The contestant must not alter the bot in any manner that reduces its weight (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed). The organizers reserve the right to arbitrate in such circumstances.

            </li>
        </ul>
<br>        
<h3>General Rules:</h3>

        <li>25 points will be awarded as it crosses any of the checkpoints but it will be counted only once for each checkpoint.
</li>
        <li>30 points will be provided if the bot successfully completes the Run.
</li>
        <li>5 points will be awarded if the bot glows the LED.
</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
<h3>Scoring:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>A = 25 points * (Number of check points covered during the Run)
</li>
        <li>B = 30 points if the bot successfully completes the Run
</li>
        <li>C = 330 - Total time taken in seconds in completing the Run
</li>
        <li>D = 5 points if the LED glows</li>
        <li>Total = A + B + C + D</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Team Specifications:</h3>
        <br>
A team may consist of a maximum of 5 participants. All the team members must belong to same educational institute.
