    <h3>HYDRAULICS  MODEL DESIGNING</h3>    
<br>
Build a manually controlled machine that can perform actions like grabbing, lifting and dumping, actuated by hydraulic force only

<h3>INTRODUCTION :</h3>
All of you may have seen cranes and JCB in real life and wondered about its working mechanism. So, to fulfil your curiosity and to relate your knowledge about fluid mechanics with real life situations Cliffesto’18 has brought a competition named HYDRAULICS.
Here you will have to make a robot using wood, aluminium, syringes and pipes only. The basic work of bot will be to grab and drop objects using its movable arms.
<br>
<h3>TASK :</h3>
Teams must build a manually controlled machine that can perform actions like grabbing, lifting and dumping. All the movements of the bot must be actuated by hydraulic force only.
<br>
<h3>RULES :</h3>
1. Bot should be made using wood, aluminum, pipes, syringes only.<br>
2. There are no height or weight restrictions for the bot.<br>
3. Force responsible for all the task done by bot should only be produced by hydraulic pressure.<br>
4. Any means of energy other than the hydraulic energy is strictly prohibited.<Br>
5. Use of motors, battery, springs or rubber bands will lead to disqualification of bot.<br>
6. Team size is restricted to a maximum of 4 members. However, there is no lower limit on the team size.<br>
7. The decision of the organizers will be final.<br>



<h3>SPECIFICATION AND CONSTRAINTS:</h3>
1. Bot should be made using wood, hardboard, aluminum, pipes, and syringes only.<br>
2. There are no height and weight restrictions for the bot.<br>
3. Force responsible for the entire task done by the bot should only be produced by hydraulic pressure.<Br>
4. Any means of energy other than the hydraulic energy is strictly prohibited.<br>
5. Use of motors, battery, spring, string or rubber will lead to disqualification of bot.<Br>
6. Team size is restricted to a maximum of 4 members. However, there is no lower limit on the team size.<br>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT :</h3>
1. There will be 5 different rounds of increasing difficulty.<br>
2. The first round is qualifiers round. Half of the teams will be selected on point’s basis for the next round.<bR>
3. The second round is qualifiers round. One fourth of the teams will be selected on point’s basis for the next round.<bR>
4. The Third round is knockout round. One eighth of the teams will be selected for semi-finals.<br>
5. Semi-Finals is a knockout round. Top 4 teams will be selected for the finals.<br>
6. Final round will be point based round. Winners will be decided on the basis points earned in this round.<br>
7. Fixtures for knockout rounds will be decided on the basis of total number of points earned by the team in all the previous rounds.<br>
    In case of any clash, the points earned in the previous round will be given preference.

<h3>QUALIFIERS:</h3>
1. There will be various balls of 3 different colours.<br>
2. Three cylindrical containers of corresponding 3 colours will be fixed at different distance from the base of the machine along the side.<br>
3. Points will be awarded only when the machine picks the ball of a particular colour and puts it into the cylindrical container of the same
colour.<br>
4. 3 minutes will be given to both the teams and all you have to do is to put maximum number of balls in corresponding coloured
cylinders.<Br>

<h3>JUDGING CRITERIA:</h3>
1. For putting the ball in the first box (nearest to it) the team will be awarded x points.<br>
2. For putting the ball in the middle box, the team will be awarded 2x points.<br>
3. For putting the ball in the box kept at extreme distance, team will be given 3x points.<br>
4. A maximum of 3 minutes for setup and 3 minutes for the task will be allocated per team.<Br>
5. Team will be short-listed for the next round on the basis of points earned.<br>
6. A total of 32 teams will be selected for the next round.<br>
7. A penalty of 2x points will be imposed if any of the team members touch the bot after the beginning of the timer for whatsoever the
reason may be.<Br>

<h3>2nd ROUND</h3>
1. There will be 10 cubical blocks of dimensions 45 x 45 x 45 mm.<bR>
2. The team is expected to make a pyramid like structure of 4 layers of cubical blocks.<br>
3. There will be time constraints for the task.<br>
4. Points will be awarded on the basis of the number of blocks correctly placed in the allocated time or time taken to complete the
pyramid, whichever occur earlier.<br>

<h3>JUDGING CRITERIA</h3>
1. The team will be awarded x points per cube for the first layer<br>
2. The team will be awarded 2x points per cube for the second layer.<br>
3. The team will be awarded 3x points per cube for the third layer.<Br>
4. The team will be awarded 4x points for placing the cube in top layer.<br>
5. A penalty of 2x points will be imposed if any of the team members touch the bot after the beginning of the timer for whatsoever
the reason may be.<br>

<h3>3rd ROUND</h3>
1. There will be rings of various dimensions hanging on a horizontal rod and 3 hooks in different orientations attached on a vertical rod.<br>
2. A thin rod will be provided at the beginning of the competition to the team which will be grabbed by the bot to pick the rings.<br>
3. The bot is expected to pick the hanging rings one at a time and place them on hooks (each hook having different points).<br>
4. Points will be awarded on the basis of number of rings placed correctly in the hook.<br>
5. There will be time constraint for this task.
<br>
        
<h3>JUDGING CRITERIA</h3>
1. For putting rings in the lowest hook x points will be awarded.<br>
2. For putting rings in the middle hook 3x points will be awarded.<br>
3. For putting rings in the uppermost hook 2x points will be awarded.<Br>
4. If multiple rings are placed at a time then points will be given considering only one ring, extra ring(s) will be placed back to the
starting position.<br>
5. Points will be strictly given after counting the number of rings placed in the hooks at the end of the task.<Br>

4. A container will be placed below the hanging balloons.<br>
5. The team is expected to remove the balloon from its thread using incense stick, and then burst it. Points will be provided only after
successfully bursting the water balloon one at a time.<br>

<h3>JUDGING CRITERIA</h3>
1. Points will be awarded on the basis of checkpoints.<br>
2. Only those checkpoints will be considered for the calculation of points which are behind or under the caster wheel after thecompletion of time allotted for the task.<br>
3. 2x points will be awarded per checkpoint.<br>
4. 5x additional points will be awarded for the completion of task in time.<br>
5. x/2 point will be deducted if caster wheel touches side walls OR loses contact with the maze surface.<br>
6. Direct crossing of maze is strictly prohibited.<br>
7. A penalty of 2x points will be imposed if any of the team members touch the bot after the beginning of the timer for whatsoever the
